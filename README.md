And they were going to the airport to [head back]() home after their meal. I [overheard]() them talking. "What an amazing trip. We've been to all the best restaurants." And they listed a [bunch](): “Per Se, Le Bernardin, Daniel, Momofuku, now Eleven Madison Park.” Then another person jumped in: "Yeah, but the only thing we didn't get to try was a New York City hotdog."

对照查词后翻译：在 2010 年早些时候，和往常一样忙的午餐时段，我在餐厅给服务生们帮忙，我在收拾开胃菜的餐盘，听到一桌来纽约度假的四位客人在谈论什么。他们在午餐后准备去机场返程。我听到他们在说“真是美妙的旅行。我们去了所有最棒的餐厅”，他们还列举了：“Per Se, Le Bernardin, Daniel, Momofuku, now Eleven Madison Park.” 另一位顾客插话道：“是的，但是我们唯一没有尝试的就是纽约的热狗”。你们知道卡通里的那些瞬间吗？就是亮起来的灯在角色的头顶闪烁，表示他们正在想出来一个确实很好的主意。

In early 2010, on a busier-than-nomal lunch service, I was in the dining room helping out the servers when I was found myslef clearing appetizers from a table of four foodies on vacation to New York. And they were going to the airport to head back home to after the meal. I was heared them talking:" What a amazing trip, we were been all that best restaurant.", and they list out much:" XXX, XXX, XXX, now Eleven Madison Park." . Then another person jumped in:" The only thing that we didn't get to try was a New York City hotdog.". You know there's a moment in the catoon where the animals,....
[You know those moments in a cartoon where the animated light bulb gose off over the character's head, signifying they're about to come up with a really good idea.]

If you been in the room with me that day, you will see I was pppp my mind. As calmlly as I possiblely could I watch greafully back in the kitchen, tro
ped off the place and liderly run up the front door on the download the hotdog card. About the hotdog, I was run just fast back the kitchen. Now can you heard hard part. Can that shut the serve in a fancy fun dining room restaurant? Guys were looking up me at losing my mind, serving like New York called a dirty water dog in a fauncy restaurant. But I asked them to trust me, then I told them that it was important to me. Advertraly, they agreed to cut up th e hotdog into four perfect pieces, and switch cccc, and switch masters on teach play, and finished in ccc salad croud,???? Then, the four that we served on the table the final ta??? "happen to be a honey levender ????????,years to perfect. We brought the hotdog,." I introduce to them, "To make sure that you don't go home with any ??? regrets , a New York hotdog."

>原文：If you’d been in the room with me that day, you would have seen one appear over mine. As calmly as I possibly could, I walked [gracefully]() back into the kitchen, dropped off the plates, and then [literally]() ran out the front door and down the block to the hotdog cart. I bought a hotdog and ran just as fast back into the kitchen. Now came the hard part: [convincing]() the chef to serve it in our fancy fine dining restaurant. Guys, he looked at me like I'd lost my mind. Serving what New Yorkers call "a dirty water dog" in a fancy four-star restaurant? But I asked him to trust me and I told him it was important to me. And eventually he agreed to cut the hotdog up into four perfect pieces, adding a little swish of ketchup and a swish of mustard onto each plate and finishing them with a [quenelle of sauerkraut]() and [a quenelle of relish]().
Then, before we served at the table their [final savory course]() -- which happened to be a [honey-lavender]() [glazed]() Muscovy duck that had been dry aged for two weeks, [utilizing]() a technique that had taken years to perfect -- we brought them their hot dog. I introduced it. "To make sure you don't go home with any [culinary]() regrets, a New York City hotdog."

对照查词后翻译：如果那天你们和我在同一房间，你们一定会见到我一面。我尽可能地冷静，我优雅的返回厨房，放下盘子，然后快速跑出前门，跑到热狗车的那条街。我以最快的速度带了一个热狗回到厨房。现在到了最难的部分：说服主厨在我们这个绝美的餐厅提供热狗。朋友们，他看着我的眼神就好像我疯了。在一个四星餐厅提供被纽约人称为“肮脏的水狗”的东西？但是我让他相信我，我告诉他这对我很重要。最后他同一把这个热狗切成完美的四份，在每个盘子上添加一点番茄酱和一点芥末酱，最后以酸菜肉汁和调味肉汁制作完成。
然后，在我们给他们上了这道热狗？？？？，我介绍道：“为了确保你们不把美食方面的遗憾带回家，这就是那道纽约热狗。”

>网站译文： 如果那天你和我一起在餐厅里， 你就会看到 我头顶就有这么一个灯泡。 我极力保持淡定， 优雅地走回厨房，放下盘子， 飞奔出前门， 冲向下个路口的热狗餐车。 我买了个热狗，又飞奔回厨房。 难题来了： 说服大厨在我们 这奢华高档的餐厅供应热狗。 他像看着疯子一样看着我。 在一家四星高档餐厅 供应纽约人口中的“脏水热狗”？ 但是我让他相信我， 我告诉他， 这对我来说非常重要。 最终，他答应把热狗 切成方方正正的四块， 每盘加一抹番茄酱， 加一抹芥末酱， 再加上一小簇酸菜和酸黄瓜酱。
在我们端上[最后一道主菜]()之前， 即干式熟成两周番鸭 佐蜂蜜薰衣草酱， 而干式熟成需要多年精进， 我们端上了热狗。 我介绍了一下。 ”为了让你们不要带着 没吃成某些美食的悔恨踏上归途， 来尝尝纽约热狗吧。”

Guys, they fraked out. I'm not kidding. At that point I cleared, I have served thousands of dishes and many many many thousands of dollars worked the food. And I can confinitaly say that no one had ever reacted everything that I served them, better than they were reacted the hot dog. Each person said, it was not only the highlight of their meal, but their tired trip in New York. And they were being to tell story for the rest of their lifes. See, that hot dog changed where the restaurant point ?? forward. Because untill that, I've been so forcus on acsurlent?? and all the little details were going to make the meal greet, that somehow I hadn't realized something really important that in restaurants are reason for being, it's to make person feel sss?? 

>原文：Guys, they [freaked out]().I'm not kidding. [At that point]() in my [career](), I had served thousands of dishes and many, many, many thousands of [dollars worth of food](). And I can [confidently]() say that no one had ever reacted to anything I served them better than they reacted to that hotdog. Each person said it was not only the highlight of their meal, but [of]() their [entire]() trip to New York, and they'd be telling the story for the rest of their [lives]().
See, that hotdog changed [the way]() I [approach]() restaurants from that point forward. Because [up until then](), I had been so focused on [excellence](), on all the little details that go into making a meal great, that I [somehow] hadn’t realized something really important: That in restaurants, our reason for being is to make people feel seen. 

>对照查词后翻译：朋友们，他们愣住了。我没开玩笑。在那时我的职业生涯中，我已经提供过上千种菜肴和成千上万美元价值的美食。我很自信的说没有人的反应会比我提供那个热狗的反应更大。每一个人都说它不仅仅是这一餐的高亮时刻，还是他们整个旅程中最高亮的时刻，他们会在之后的人生给别人讲述这件事。看，这个热狗改变了我之前经营餐厅的方式。因为知道那一刻，我一直专注于聪明的方式，为了完成一道佳肴，我在所有小的细节尽善尽美，在某种程度上，我没有意识到一件很重要的事儿：在餐厅里，我们做的所有事情都是为了让顾客感觉自己被关注到。

>官方翻译：他们目瞪口呆。我没在开玩笑。 在我职业生涯的那个节点， 我已经端上了上千道菜， 价值上万美元的食物。 我可以自信地说， 没有人有过像他们 看到热狗时那样的反应。 两个人都说，这不仅仅是 他们这顿饭的亮点， 也是纽约之行的亮点， 这会成为他们 接下来人生中的谈资。
看看，这个热狗从这一瞬间 改变了我运营餐厅的方式。 在此之前，我一直心无旁骛地 扑在餐品的尽善尽美上， 死抠每一个细节， 让这顿饭完美无瑕， 但是忽略了至关重要的一点： 对于一个餐厅来说， 我们存在的价值就是 让人们感到他们被用心关注了。 让人们感到自己受到了款待。
