>原文：In early 2010, on a [busier-than-normal]() lunch service, I was in the dining room helping out the servers when I found myself clearing [appetizers]() from a table of four [foodies]() on vacation to New York. And they were going to the airport to [head back]() home after their meal. I [overheard]() them talking. "What an amazing trip. We've been to all the best restaurants." And they listed a [bunch](): “Per Se, Le Bernardin, Daniel, Momofuku, now Eleven Madison Park.” Then another person jumped in: "Yeah, but the only thing we didn't get to try was a New York City hotdog." You know those moments in a cartoon where the [animated]() light [bulb]() [goes off over]() the character's head, signifying they're about to come up with a really good idea?

对照查词后翻译：在 2010 年早些时候，和往常一样忙的午餐时段，我在餐厅给服务生们帮忙，我在收拾开胃菜的餐盘，听到一桌来纽约度假的四位客人在谈论什么。他们在午餐后准备去机场返程。我听到他们在说“真是美妙的旅行。我们去了所有最棒的餐厅”，他们还列举了：“Per Se, Le Bernardin, Daniel, Momofuku, now Eleven Madison Park.” 另一位顾客插话道：“是的，但是我们唯一没有尝试的就是纽约的热狗”。你们知道卡通里的那些瞬间吗？就是亮起来的灯在角色的头顶闪烁，表示他们正在想出来一个确实很好的主意。

>网站译文：2010 年初， 比平常忙碌的午市， 我在餐厅里帮服务员打下手， 为四位来纽约度假的美食爱好者 收拾开胃菜的餐盘。 他们打算在饭后前往机场回家。 我偶然间听到了他们的对话。 “多好的旅途啊。 我们跑遍了最好的餐厅。” 然后他们说了一堆： “Per Se，Le Bernardin，Momofuku， 现在我们来了麦迪逊公园十一号。” 另一个人插话道： “没错，但是我们 没去尝一尝纽约的热狗。”想象一下动画片里， 卡通灯泡在角色头顶亮了起来， 意思是他们想到了 一个超棒的点子。
